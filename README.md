## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a new Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Enable reCAPTCHA Enterprise
4. Download `google-services.json`
5. Add SHA-1 fingerprint for your app

### Supabase Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the database setup script:
   ```sql
   -- Create user_profiles table
   CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     firebase_uid TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
     email TEXT NOT NULL,
     photo_url TEXT,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Create water_fetch_posts table
   CREATE TABLE water_fetch_posts (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     firebase_uid TEXT NOT NULL,
     message TEXT NOT NULL,
     fetch_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Single',
     partner_user_id TEXT,
     points DECIMAL(3,1) NOT NULL,
     verification_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
     verified_by TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
     rejected_by TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE water_fetch_posts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create policies
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view all profiles" ON user_profiles
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles
     FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid()::text = firebase_uid);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = firebase_uid);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can view all posts" ON water_fetch_posts
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own posts" ON water_fetch_posts
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = firebase_uid);
   ```

## 📱 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the app** - You'll see the welcome screen
2. **Create an account** - Sign up with email and full name
3. **Start tracking** - Post your first water fetching activity

### Creating Activities
1. **Choose mode**: Single or Together
2. **Choose bottles**: 1 bottle or 2 bottles (affects points)
3. **For Together mode**: Select a partner from the dropdown
4. **Write a message** describing your activity
5. **Post activity** - It will appear in your feed

### Understanding Points
- **Single Mode**: 1 bottle → 0.5 points; 2 bottles → 1.0 point
- **Together Mode**: 1 bottle → 0.25 points each; 2 bottles → 0.5 points each
- **Totals**: Together total = per-user points × 2 (poster + partner)
- **Verification**: Activities start as "pending" until verified
- **Owner delete**: You can delete your own post until it’s verified
- **Decision locking**: After you verify/reject a post, your decision is locked

### Navigation
- **Home Tab**: View and create activities
- **Leaderboard Tab**: See user rankings
- **Profile Tab**: View your stats and logout

## 🔄 Process & Working Method

### End-to-end flow
- **Post creation**
  - Choose mode (Single/Together), pick bottles (1 or 2), write a message, and for Together select a partner.
  - The app computes per-user points and saves a post in Supabase with these values:
    - Single: 1 bottle → 0.5, 2 bottles → 1.0
    - Together: 1 bottle → 0.25 each, 2 bottles → 0.5 each
  - Fields stored: `message`, `fetch_type`, `partner_user_id` (partner display name), `points` (per-user), `firebase_uid` (owner), `verification_status`, `verified_by`, `rejected_by`.
  - A notification is sent to all other users announcing the new post.

- **Home feed & actions**
  - Each post shows status (pending/verified/rejected), message, and points. Together posts show “points each”.
  - The post owner never sees verify/reject; they see a Delete button (only while the post is not verified).
  - Other users can verify or reject exactly once; after deciding, the controls are hidden for them (decision locking).

- **Verification / Rejection**
  - Verify updates Supabase: sets `verification_status` to `verified`, adds the verifier to `verified_by`, removes them from `rejected_by` if present, and notifies the owner.
  - Reject updates Supabase similarly (`rejected_by`) and notifies the owner.

- **Points aggregation**
  - The `points` column stores per-user points for the post.
  - Leaderboard/Profile totals:
    - For posts you created (poster): sum your posts’ `points` where `verification_status = verified`.
    - For Together posts where you are the partner: sum the post `points` (also per-user) where `partner_user_id = your name` and `verification_status = verified`.
  - Daily totals shown in the UI treat Together posts as `points * 2` to reflect both users’ contributions.

- **Delete behavior**
  - Owners can delete their own posts until the post is verified. Deleting removes the row from Supabase and the item from the feed.

- **Notifications & permissions**
  - The app requests notification permission at startup (Android 13+ and iOS) using `permission_handler`.
  - Android uses `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`. iOS includes `NSUserNotificationUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`.
  - Notifications are created in the `notifications` table and fetched per user.

### Data model guarantees
- Per-user points are stored directly on each post (`water_fetch_posts.points`).
- Together posts store the partner’s display name in `partner_user_id` for easy partner lookup.
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only insert/update their own data.
